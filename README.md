## 📌 About The Repository

This repository is dedicated to learning and experimenting with Solana, a high-performance blockchain designed for decentralized applications and crypto-currencies. It contains hands-on examples and exercises using both TypeScript and Rust.

The repository is organized into different sections to provide a comprehensive guide for developers interested in building on Solana.

### 📂 Repository Structure

- **[pre-request](./airdrop)**: This folder contains examples of interacting with Solana's RPC using TypeScript. It includes scripts to perform operations such as querying account data, sending transactions, and more.
- **[rust-pre-request](./rust-prereq)**: This folder contains examples of interacting with Solana's RPC using Rust. It includes scripts to perform operations such as querying account data, sending transactions, and more.
- **[spl-token](./spl-token)**: This folder contains examples of creating and interacting with SPL tokens on Solana. It includes scripts to create tokens and NFT, transfer tokens, and more.
